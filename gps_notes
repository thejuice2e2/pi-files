Setting the computer time using GPS

Now we have a working GPS we can now get the PI to use it for setting the time. To do this we need to configure ntp to use the GPS satellites as a time source. Now you should already have ntp installed but if not then you need to install it:
pi@raspberrypi:~$ sudo apt-get install ntp
Next you need to edit the file: /etc/ntp.conf and add a few lines to it defining the GPS. This can be either before or after the existing lines beginning with server:
# gps ntp
server 127.127.28.0 minpoll 4
fudge  127.127.28.0 time1 0.183 refid NMEA
server 127.127.28.1 minpoll 4 prefer
fudge  127.127.28.1 refid PPS
Now restart ntp:
pi@raspberrypi:~$ sudo service ntp restart
Now if you query the server you should after a while see it synchronize:
pi@raspberrypi:~$ ntpq -p
